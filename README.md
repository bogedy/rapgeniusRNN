# rapgeniusRNN
A deep character RNN for generating rap lyrics

clean.py -- cleaning up the lyrics data

corpus.py -- list of songs to scrape lyrics for

generate.ipynb -- notebook for generating text samples

lyrics.txt -- lyrics data

output.txt -- sample output

rapgenius.ipynb -- notebook for training model

scrape.py -- script for scraping lyrics form genius.com

The model was written using Keras with Tensorflow as the backend, according to the tutorial on this page https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/sequences/text_generation. The lyric scraping was done according to this guide https://bigishdata.com/2016/09/27/getting-song-lyrics-from-geniuss-api-scraping/. Understanding of RNN's came from Karpathy's original blog post and this blog post on LSTMs, which I also referenced in my literature review http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/.
